Let me try to elaborate on this.', '1) IT FAILS AS A MOVIE IN GENERAL.', 'The Last Jedi is fatally plagued by plot holes. Deus Ex Machinas, poor plot choices. The idea of the cat-and-mouse chase between the first order fleet and the rebels is not bad, but it is poorly executed. When watching the rebels slow escape I never felt a sense of impending danger and that caused a sense of detachment from the all situation. A similar plot device was used by Battlestar Galactica (the rebooted season) in a much more convincing way, because there the show manages to convey the threat of the pursuers. Additionally, the whole Casino plotline feels out of place, detached from the story and eventually usesless because it does not add anything to the story. The only thing it achieves is to break the pace pf the chase.', ""The jokes throughout the movie also felt out of place and put there just for their own sake. Seriously, was it neccessary to have the scene with Kylo Ren withouth shirt just to make that silly joke? What's the point of it?"", '2) IT FAILS AS THE SECOND MOVIE OF A TRILOGY', ""I didn't like the lack of originality of the Force Awakens, but that movie managed at least to create some interesting questions. Who are Rey's parents? Who is Snoke? In the Last Jedi the director Rian Johnson takes all these most interesting points and throws them out in the garbage. All the expectations that were built by TFA are just shuttered in TLJ. I feel like this has all been done on purpose by the director, who tried too hard to shock fans. Unfortunately, this is cannot work in a trilogy where you should build on the previous episode rather than making a tabula rasa at all costs. Another example of this is the story of Luke. The whole Force Awakens story revolted around the quest to find Luke Skywalker, because he was hinted to be (both by the rebellion and by the first Order) to be the one who will tilt the fate of the war. After one full movie looking for him, the Last Jedi makes this whole search for Luke totally meaningless. Finding Luke Skywalker didn't advance the story in any way. He didn't leave his planet, basically he didn't train Ray (that cannot be called training), he didn't pass any knowledge to the rebels, he didn't challenge the First Order in any way. If Luke Skywalker was removed from this movie the advancement of the story wouldn't have suffered at all, perhaps the movie would have even be better given the poor portrayal of its character. After watching the Last Jedi I couldn't help but asking myself why Snoke was so worried about Luke Skywalker. The Last Jedi simply took all the key questions and the main plot line of the Force Awakens (search for Luke) and destroyed them mercilessly."", '3) IT FAILS AS A STAR WARS STORY', 'When I went to watch the Last Jedi, I was not only expecting to get some answers for all the questions raised by the Force Awakens. I was also expecting to see rich Star Wars lore be respectfully honored. However, my feeling after the movie is that The Last Jedi has broken Star Wars beyond repair. The most damage was done to the character of Luke Skywalker, once an impulsive but kind person who would not give up even on the worst person, now a shell of a man who is willing to kill his nephew during his sleep. I also would have liked to see a display of his powers, but we never get that either. Not to mention that there is no lightsaber duel, yet another letdown. The fact that Rian Johnson killed Luke makes me think of a kid who would rather break a toy rather than leaving it to another kid (JJ Abrams) to play with.']"

973894774	['Josh D']	1.0	"['*SPOILERS* I\'ve always heard about people being upset about a director ""ruining a childhood hero"" but never really experienced it until The Last Jedi. Aside from a few good action sequences this movie was abysmal. Luke Skywalker went from the quintessential hero to a fear driven hermit with no confidence. His backstory with Ben Solo made it even worse. Luke went from the man who never waivered in his belief that Vader could be redeemed to believing Ben Solo was a lost cause before he was even turned. The big mysteries everyone was excited about since VII? ""Who is Snoke?"" ""Who were Rey\'s parents?"" turned out to be ""Who cares?"" and ""Nobody."" Where J.J.\'s movie turned out to be a unimaginative but well-made fond rememberance, Rian\'s movie was a poorly made perversion of Luke Skywalker\'s character. I know Mark Hamill walked back his reservations but I\'m inclined to think he was told to. Possibly the most frustrating thing about this new trilogy is how empty and hollow the victory in Return of the Jedi was. The Rebel Alliance went from a real resistance with resources and massive victories to a small and now destroyed fleet reduced to a pack of survivors crammed into the Falcon. I\'ve said in the past that Ren is a kind of sad sack replacement for Vader but he\'s apparently far more successful at stamping out resistance forces. The professional critics must\'ve seen ""Star Wars"" in the title and gave this a pass but I\'ve seen better movies with a rotten score than this 91% and judging from the audience reception I\'m not alone.']"

TLJ needs a major overhaul just to hit poor. I've seen it twice now and no doubt the movie has its high visual moments and Mark Hamill's performance is outstanding... but overall a weak story and bad movie. The entire codebreaker storyline (30+ minutes?) was absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary the removal of which would bring the movie in at a tight two hours (in 18 or so hours Finn and Rose are supposed to exit a battlefield, fly to another planet, find a guy with a red rose lapel in a casino they don't know by name (or species?), fly him back, sneak onto a Star Destroyer and deactivate a tracking device? What?! What if the guy isn't in the casino (or on the planet) that day? And the guy they do get isn't even the right guy.. and all of this side show advanced the plot not an iota). This part of the plot was so useless that I don't think I've fully wrapped my mind around the (political) point trying to be made (but yes, make no mistake about it, you are being preached to). We learn nothing about Snoke (and guess we won't find out or even care now). When Leia blew off the ship like an Alien I jumped in my seat.. great scene.. then she Forces her way back to the ship Mary Poppins style? What?! Since when did she have anything other than Force sensitivity? Like so many things it just doesn't follow what we've seen before; but in an illogical way not a creative one. Kylo Ren is a ridiculous character/impetuous child, the Rebellion is (or was) led by Leia, without Leia we get Laura Dern, Finn used to be great but now he has to be saved from his toxic masculinity by Rose and Poe was ok but he mutinies (yes, mutinies) so he has to be reeled in by Leia and Dern then Hux is made out to be an idiot. Han is dead and Luke used to be great but is now broken and then dead (and not nearly as powerful as Rey). Star Wars movies are (little) chick movies now. There is no reason to take your young sons to see this movie.. the lesson being taught is that men need to be told what to do by women, that sacrifice by the female character (Dern) is a noble exercise, by the male character (Finn) futile and violent despite both sacrifices having the same goal. There are several other major criticisms (B DelT and Laura Dern both awful, etc.) The humor is a bit much but would have been ok.. if not for the fact that you get to the end of the movie and realize the story and characters have not been taken seriously.. and in retrospect the humor falls flat... but the most egregious offense? Like killing the lore of Darth Vader with the prequels, today they ruin the beloved Luke Skywalker character with an uncharacteristic attempted assassination of a sleeping child (what?!), an unwillingness to help the cause that ends too late and a death that made absolutely no sense except to [try to] salvage a weak story bringing Luke's post Death Star contribution to the cause to almost nothing except saving Han Solo in VI and 30 or so Rebels now... after all of Force Awakens, he doesn't even get off the planet?! FA that was all about setting up the search for Luke is now a pointless exercise (Rebel's never seem to be any better off after destroying a big weapon) and when you now ask the question if the galaxy overall was better off for the Skywalker family, the answer is now arguably no. Frankly I feel bad for Mark Hamill.. from the initial FA read to now, I get the vibe like he was a fan and was looking for that moment for his character for the fans that never came to pass. I've been a fan for 40 years and remember running to the TV to watch Jeffrey Lyons review Empire and maybe see a minute trailer of Luke confronting Vader; I saw Jedi twice the day it opened and ten or so times that summer.. and on and on and on... Corvette Summer, Leave Yesterday Behind, all of it.. but now, as far as Star Wars goes.. and it pains me to say it... there will be no Solo story, there will be no Episode IX .. I'm on Ahch-to.""]"

977006982	['Carlo M']	0.5	"['In my opinion this The Last Jedi fails on many different levels. Let me try to elaborate on this.', '1) IT FAILS AS A MOVIE IN GENERAL.', 'The Last Jedi is fatally plagued by plot holes. Deus Ex Machinas, poor plot choices. The idea of the cat-and-mouse chase between the first order fleet and the rebels is not bad, but it is poorly executed. When watching the rebels slow escape I never felt a sense of impending danger and that caused a sense of detachment from the all situation. A similar plot device was used by Battlestar Galactica (the rebooted season) in a much more convincing way, because there the show manages to convey the threat of the pursuers. Additionally, the whole Casino plotline feels out of place, detached from the story and eventually usesless because it does not add anything to the story. The only thing it achieves is to break the pace pf the chase.', ""The jokes throughout the movie also felt out of place and put there just for their own sake. Seriously, was it neccessary to have the scene with Kylo Ren withouth shirt just to make that silly joke? What's the point of it?"", '2) IT FAILS AS THE SECOND MOVIE OF A TRILOGY', ""I didn't like the lack of originality of the Force Awakens, but that movie managed at least to create some interesting questions. Who are Rey's parents? Who is Snoke? In the Last Jedi the director Rian Johnson takes all these most interesting points and throws them out in the garbage. All the expectations that were built by TFA are just shuttered in TLJ. I feel like this has all been done on purpose by the director, who tried too hard to shock fans. Unfortunately, this is cannot work in a trilogy where you should build on the previous episode rather than making a tabula rasa at all costs. Another example of this is the story of Luke. The whole Force Awakens story revolted around the quest to find Luke Skywalker, because he was hinted to be (both by the rebellion and by the first Order) to be the one who will tilt the fate of the war. After one full movie looking for him, the Last Jedi makes this whole search for Luke totally meaningless. Finding Luke Skywalker didn't advance the story in any way. He didn't leave his planet, basically he didn't train Ray (that cannot be called training), he didn't pass any knowledge to the rebels, he didn't challenge the First Order in any way. If Luke Skywalker was removed from this movie the advancement of the story wouldn't have suffered at all, perhaps the movie would have even be better given the poor portrayal of its character. After watching the Last Jedi I couldn't help but asking myself why Snoke was so worried about Luke Skywalker. The Last Jedi simply took all the key questions and the main plot line of the Force Awakens (search for Luke) and destroyed them mercilessly."", '3) IT FAILS AS A STAR WARS STORY', 'When I went to watch the Last Jedi, I was not only expecting to get some answers for all the questions raised by the Force Awakens. I was also expecting to see rich Star Wars lore be respectfully honored. However, my feeling after the movie is that The Last Jedi has broken Star Wars beyond repair. The most damage was done to the character of Luke Skywalker, once an impulsive but kind person who would not give up even on the worst person, now a shell of a man who is willing to kill his nephew during his sleep. I also would have liked to see a display of his powers, but we never get that either. Not to mention that there is no lightsaber duel, yet another letdown. The fact that Rian Johnson killed Luke makes me think of a kid who would rather break a toy rather than leaving it to another kid (JJ Abrams) to play with.']"

I am willing to look past the ridiculous events that interrupted my suspension of belief (such as Snoke being killed by his very weak apprentice while allegedly reading his mind). I am willing to overlook the missed chances to have made this an emotionally stirring movie by allowing Princess Mary Poppins to die. However, I am not willing to overlook the absolute, intentional slaughter of Luke Skywalker. The entire first trilogy focuses on developing this character. Luke is destined to be the strongest Jedi in history. There are at least a half dozen ways he could have been made the last Jedi while showing his true power, something the original trilogy never got to as he was still a novice at the end of Return of the Jedi. I will tell you when the whole movie was lost to me: When Luke ""fights"" Kylo and then dies of exertion or whatever that was. What. The. Heck. What he should have done (again, there are a half dozen ways this movie could have fulfilled its destiny) was use the force to a degree never before seen, like crushing those ATATs together in one fell swoop. Of course, my expectations were a bit dampered when Rey discovers Luke had wasted decades of time we all thought he had spent training by disconnecting from the force. I could write a ten page review about how badly they messed this up. I feel like a 7 year old kid could have done a better job writing a script that fit the story.

973894774	['Josh D']	1.0	"['*SPOILERS* I\'ve always heard about people being upset about a director ""ruining a childhood hero"" but never really experienced it until The Last Jedi. Aside from a few good action sequences this movie was abysmal. Luke Skywalker went from the quintessential hero to a fear driven hermit with no confidence. His backstory with Ben Solo made it even worse. Luke went from the man who never waivered in his belief that Vader could be redeemed to believing Ben Solo was a lost cause before he was even turned. The big mysteries everyone was excited about since VII? ""Who is Snoke?"" ""Who were Rey\'s parents?"" turned out to be ""Who cares?"" and ""Nobody."" Where J.J.\'s movie turned out to be a unimaginative but well-made fond rememberance, Rian\'s movie was a poorly made perversion of Luke Skywalker\'s character. I know Mark Hamill walked back his reservations but I\'m inclined to think he was told to. Possibly the most frustrating thing about this new trilogy is how empty and hollow the victory in Return of the Jedi was. The Rebel Alliance went from a real resistance with resources and massive victories to a small and now destroyed fleet reduced to a pack of survivors crammed into the Falcon. I\'ve said in the past that Ren is a kind of sad sack replacement for Vader but he\'s apparently far more successful at stamping out resistance forces. The professional critics must\'ve seen ""Star Wars"" in the title and gave this a pass but I\'ve seen better movies with a rotten score than this 91% and judging from the audience reception I\'m not alone.']"

I was skeptical about The Force Awakens when it came out, but it won me over with its teasing mysteries, breathless sense of fun, and awareness of the source material. In fact, there was such momentum going into The Last Jedi that I was quite looking forward to learning more about what had happened and who these new characters were. Perhaps this is why, upon reflection, I was so amazingly disappointed in this film. After a gripping opening action sequence, this film slows to a crawl. After waiting for decades to see Luke back in action, we find that this film turns him into a grumpy joke that behaves in a distractingly our-of-character fashion. This is the first of many divisive/poor script decisions in the film. Then, by the time the film finds an opportunity to address them, the mysteries from the last film are completely disregarded. After six films relating to the rise to power of Emperor Palpatine, suddenly a new, more menacing Sith-like dark lord has appeared, despite the Sith being destroyed. Who is he? Where did he come from? Why did he surface only after the Empire fell? How did he become so knowledgeable? Suspending my curiosity for one film (The Force Awakens) was something I was willing to do. Completely suspending these questions for two films after the rest of the six-film saga had such tight connective tissue is a bridge too far to me and indicative of lazy scripting. Based on the events of this film, I doubt we'll ever have answers that make sense in the context of the overall saga. Also, Rey becomes distractingly powerful after Luke (disappointingly) refuses to really train her or join the heroes. The entire film was something of a plodding downer that quashed all of the momentum of the previous film to me. Now, the previous heroes have been shrugged off too soon, without really connecting me to the new ones, and for the first time in my life I find myself looking back with fondness upon the deeply-flawed prequel films and without excitement for the last installment, which I find faces an all but impossible challenge to conclude the Skywalker saga in any truly satisfying way. Pros: The way that Snoke was defeated was clever, the use of Force telepathy and expanded mythos was intriguing, and the kamikaze use of a hyperspacing star-cruiser was truly spectacular.

There's some really amazing moments, the actors are pretty incredible, especially Mark Hamill and Adam Driver, and the action is used sparsely but great when it delivers. But the tone is kind of a disaster, the pacing is all over the place (especially considering how long it is AND feels), and there's some real weird editing. If I was asked to sum up what this movie was about, I don't think I could even say. I think there's a great story in here, but it feels like it's constantly battling with several other stories for attention, and keeps getting in its own way. Eh, if you like Star Wars you'll probably like this, but I just wasn't really engaged a lot of the time; sometimes I felt like I was watching one of the prequels. I feel like I'm missing something seeing all these glowing reviews. In particular I can't believe people seriously claiming this movie does new and different things for Star Wars: it's such a blatant perpetuation of the exact same cycle as the original trilogy with such superficial tweaks. In the Force Awakens it didn't bother me as much because they were trying to get people back on board with classic Star Wars after the prequel disasters, and introduce these new characters with some different flaws to work on. But then this movie squandered almost all of that and just continued to rehash things, and it's no longer as justifiable.

No, I am not a troll, a hater , a white supremacist, or part of the ""conspiracy group"" to bring down Disney. And yes, I think the ""critics"" and the raving idiots giving this movie 5 stars are simple-minded, half-wits. First let me start off with the fact that I am more of ""The Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the rings "" girl, however I love Star Wars, and especially the The Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith. I was not born when the original triology was released, but I found it to be mesmerizing. I don\'t really understand why the prequels are so despised by some fans since they told the story of how everything started, including the journey of Anakin Skywalker from a Jedi to a Sith. I loved Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kanobi and Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader. They both had depth and convincibility that the new characters lack in many respects. I even enjoyed Darth Sidius (the Lord Sith) manipulative and conniving ways, he knew just what to say and when to say it in order to bring the worst in Anakin.', 'The Force Awakens was passable, however I hated that they so quickly got rid off Han Solo, but I was excited at the promise of Luke Skywalker in the upcoming movie. What a mistake on my part...Instead of getting the Grand Master Jedi, who could have replaced Yoda as the leading Jedi, I lived to see this marvelous character milk a walrus, drink green milk , and catch the fakest looking fish possible. Then we have to listen to the stalest, most forced , copy cat dialogue between Rey and Luke. With Rey trying to talk Luke into training her so she can convert Rylo( another idea borrowed from previous Star Wars films). Then we witness Rey\'s 5 minute lesson on how to become a Jedi when she slices a rock and watches it roll down the cliff breaking the card of the poor frog looking caretakers of the Jedi Temple( one of the few comedic moments I found funny). Rey becomes so powerful that she even defeats her teacher Luke - totally unbelievable. Then we get the utterly boring and completely illogical space ship chase, the made-to look ridiculous general of the First Order and the absolutely annoying, condescending, arrogant and unlikable Admiral Hux, the purple haired lady. The only satisfying thing about her character was when se decided to stay in the mother ship and kill herself in order for the other pitiful bunch of losers to escape (one would think that such an advance ship would have autopilot and would not need anyone staying behind, but as I said I was overjoyed to see her go). If only Admiral Hux has told Poe and Finn about her plan, there would be no need for the Casino scenes, but the ""heroic lady ""did not want to appear as a martyr or a hero so she kept it all to herself.', ""And then we get those stupid looking birds-Porges.

Rian Johnson was the perfect choice for this direction. The Empire Strikes Back made many decisions that made the story of Star Wars more than just a sequence of action driving scenarios.

Our new protagonists have their own set of challenges that push them in evolving directions.

She wants to help him, but doesn\'t want to join him, but wants to kill him....? The best part of the movie was the two of them taking down the red guards. Kylo\'s best acting was when he was pleading with her to join him. Also, Rey wasn\'t afraid to dive into the evil, dark hole beneath the island and only saw her infinite self - interesting, but what does that really tell us about her as a character? If she asked to see her parents and only saw herself, she realized she was the only one who mattered in her life, not her past, not her future destiny or choice, just her as she was and feeling extremely lonely for it. So now she is alone and tells Kylo that he is not alone...?', 'If the Jedi made a ""religion"" out of using the Force, and The Last Jedi is about abolishing the religious order of using the Force (if, as they say in the movie, the Force is the energy and balance between all living things), then nothing is truly good or truly evil. Everything is just a grey power struggle and people get hurt on both sides. All you have to do to acquire the power of the Force, good or bad, is to stretch out your feelings....but then how come not everyone has the Force? Some have a genetic propensity for it, or is that not true anymore? If the Force is accessible to anyone with good or bad intentions, then that also seems to open the universe to chaos of a higher, destructive power.

It was an entertaining film, just not a ""Star Wars"" film.�The original trilogy was 100% typical good vs evil, destiny vs choice....it relied on tried and true tropes that have been the building blocks of all the enduring and most meaningful stories - good winning over evil, and narrative arcs that made sense with an emotional payoff. You can\'t take out the structure and mythology of Star Wars and expect it to be Star Wars. It feels hollow, because it has all the appearance of it (sounds, space ships, storm troopers), but there is nothing holding it together.�What is the purpose of this story?

Rogue One fue una obra de arte y Episodio VII era un buen comienzo. Pero Episodio VIII no es una historia de Star Wars']

As a long time Star Wars fan and having loved The Force Awakens I am amazed at how they completely failed at this one. By the end of TFA we had Rey finding a beloved Jedi master, introduced an insidious new villain (Snoke), set up mysteries of lineage and back story and the visions of future epic jedi battles dancing in our heads. Everything was in place for an exciting continuation of the Star Wars Skywalker story. Instead we witnessed an incoherent story line with a failure at every level of the set up from Episode 7. I will break this down into specific nonchronilogical failures otherwise this review will go on forever. Snoke, a scary and powerful master force user with no back story is killed in a most anticlimactic way. Luke Skywalker is a sad, pouting and shallow character who instead of us showing his true power pulls a trans galactic hologram hoax and then as the audience applauds with the realization he is safe simply disappears and becomes one with the force? The mystery parents of Rey\'s that were theorized about for two years and promised to be revealed were nobody of importance (then why was Luke\'s lightsaber calling to her). Instead of Luke ""passing on what he has learned"" he teaches Rey three lessons two of which were not lessons and not memorable. A lot of time was spent watching a a slow moving space ship chase with an inconsequential failed mutiny. A side story with Finn and Rose was nothing more than a lecture on class warfare and the evils of the military industrial complex. Too many times the characters were saved just in the nick of time by shear luck. Snoke\'s promise of completing Kylo\'s training was nothing more than humiliation and the challenge of striking down Rey after it was revealed the connection between Ren and Rey was orchestrated through Snoke. Mighty Chewbacca could not eat a Porg after living Porgs stared at him. I could go on and on with silliness and tragic story flaws and failures of understanding of what made Star Wars so great. The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not less was because of a few scenes. The jump to light speed through Snokes ship was beautifully done. We saw two moments of a recognizable Luke (laying on the ground chatting with a very bad CGI puppet looking Yoda and floating while meditating before disappearing). This movie was so frustratingly disappointing I left the theater feeling depressed. No epic Jedi battles (even the battle with the Pratorian guards was silly and anticlimactic), no jaw dropping moments of revelation, no character development (so why should we care). Instead we are left with the only intimidating villain dead, Luke disappearing after not teaching anything or showing us his true power, weird force powers invented (Leia floating through space was a beautiful yet silly scene...makes all those space ship battles wth the Jedi less impressive knowing they could just fly through space back to safety). Sorry, I am going on and on because this movie was such a mess. The only explanation I can guess as to the critics good reviews are that they either own a lot of Disney stock or are terrified to give a bad review due to Disney\'s power in the entertainment industry. I am heart broken and disappointed.', ""Amended: After seeing it a second time (in 3D) I changed it to a 3 with the hopes of correcting some major issues with Johnson's writing and directing blasphemy."", ""1. The only thing we know about Rey's parents is what Snoke revealed to Kylo in their visions about each other. Snoke admits that he lied to them because Kylo was too weak and Rey was not wise enough. So the anticlimactic ending to Rey's lineage can be corrected."", '2. Luke can still come back and pass on what he has learned if he returns as a force ghost. This is likely because he tells Kylo that he will see him around. We also have a scene where Rey has the Jedi texts in the Millenium Falcon at the end of the movie.', '3. Kylo maybe more of an adversary then I gave him credit for. He does trick Snoke into believing that Snoke can see his true intent which allows the apprentice to kill his master....a very common theme in the Sith. He also wants Rey to join him which is a common theme with Anakin wanting to over throw the Emperor and ruling the galaxy with Padme in Revenge of the Sith and then with Luke in Return of the Jedi.', '4. A dominant theme in the movie is suggested by Yoda...failure is the greatest teacher. Finn and Rose failing on their mission. Poe failing with his mutiny. Kylo failing to turn Rey to his side. Rey failing to convince Luke to return. Hopefully all of these failings teach these main characters how to become stronger in the future, turning them all into true leaders.']"

You just need someone with experience in the force to guide them.', 'There were a few places where the story dragged or strained credulity, (*SPOILER ALERT*) like when the princess was propelling herself through deep space after a blast that should have killed her. Much of the time spent on the magical Jedi island was boring and unnecessary. Luke made some poor choices (much as Ben Kenobi did before him) when faced with the dark side. The whole thing could have been a good 30 minutes shorter without losing any story. There was an unnecessary cute bird character that didn\'t seem to add anything to the story. I guess they were trying for a ""baby groot"" character. If so, they failed.', ""The action sequences were numerous and successful. The character of Rey was deepened and enhanced in her relationship to her brother, Kylo Ren, who killed their father, Han Solo. There was some cools stuff with Princess Leia's character and how she leads the resistance. My favorite scene in the movie was with BB8 saving everyone in a surprise move filled with suspense. And the stuff with Poe's and Finn's characters was satisfying. Honestly, I think Adam Driver, as Kylo, was clearly the standout performance.

I no longer go back to re-watch these movies. The ideas are stale and there is no fresh life in them.

Lucas was terrible with the previous three movies. He couldn't be trusted to maintain the quality of the early movies. It would only take one more bad Star Wars sequel to ruin the whole thing.

But, after reading many negative reactions and thinking, ""What about this film is pissing off so many fans of Star Wars?"", I\'ve become hesitant in my assessment for the film. So this is my honest opinion, after yet another Star Wars high. This review contains spoilers.', ""STORY: In comparison to Episode VII, and as part of a whole series, the story of The Last Jedi is actually kinda new. Yes, there are several beats here and there, both Star Wars-related (such as training and a throne room climax) AND modern Hollywood-related (story cliches). But the SW-related beats are nowhere near the level of the Force Awakens, and the Hollywood-related beats are very minor, but noticeable. After all, this is the eight film is the franchise. There's nothing new under the sun. This was a surprise, given the 40 years of popularity and recent changes in the industry. And I appreciated the direction Johnson took these characters, despite their haphazard introductions in the previous chapter. 3/4"", 'SCRIPT: In retrospect, the movie opens somewhat dull, like The Phantom Menace, then gets right into a long action sequence that goes on a little *too* long; but after that, each scene is simply better than the last--with a few lags here and there, especially at the end. The dialogue--especially Luke\'s dialogue--was pure gold; some of best SW dialogue in a while. The flow of the narrative works really well, and there are some really good Star Wars-y lines that felt authentic. I thought the humor got in the way at times throughout the film, especially in the opening and with Poe and Hux. That was kind of annoying And they forgot to include, ""I have a bad feeling about this""! Negatives: I felt that the other characters besides Rey, Luke, and Ben just kinda populate the script to have subplots that fill up time when really what we want to see is Rey, Luke, and Ben. Indeed, the script does a decent job balancing those subplots, and the scene in the throne room narrows down the focus and gets right to the point with this trilogy: it\'s about Rey and Ben. But that\'s all at the climax; The Last Jedi is bogged with a Poe-Vs.-Leadership subplot, Finn-and-Rose-are-heroes-and-fall-in-love subplot, Leia\'s superpowers which are never really addressed again, and stuff that just doesn\'t need to be so prevalent in this movie. But in the end, it serves to better develop the characters, yes at the expense of a 152 minute runtime, but this shows that Johnson at least wrote this movie around individuals and not just Star Wars-y stuff; it shows he cared enough to develop the characters, and if 152 minutes is what you need, then 152 minutes is what you\'ll get. I just wish it could have been done in some more clever way. 2/4', ""CHARACTERS: Rian Johnson's task was to continue the story of these new characters, and he did his best to put them in positions where each can grow. And some of them do, namely Rey, Ben, and Luke. The others have personalities and they all have arcs-- but they just aren't as memorable as the main three, or the characters in the original trilogy. I guess the issue is that there are too MANY characters in this movie. Also, what they did with Snoke was completely out of left field and undercuts the Force Awakens--making it even more meaningless than it already is. I understand Snoke's end is to narrow the focus of the trilogy, but now his presence in the first movie is unnecessary. So, why not just have Hux be the Supreme Leader and/or Kylo Ren's master from the get-go? He's a more realistic character than Snoke or the Emperor, and that would be kind of different for this trilogy. But he's still around...and it's weird. And Snoke is pointless... WTF? Anyway, Finn didn't really grow so much; Poe does but his story is like a completely different movie; Leia grows into her own in The Last Jedi, filling in the wise sage role that Luke does, but in a kinder light that also worked really well. Luke's characterization was excellent both as an addition to Rey's journey and as a continuation of his own; really satisfying ending with him. Ben's character direction really surprised me; I think I liked Rey more and really rooted for her in this one, although part of me wishes she had turned!!! What a setup that would be. 3/4"", ""DIRECTION: Johnson's directing is very good here given his style and the material. It's stylistically different from the rest of the saga, and contains some very visually interesting scenes I never thought we'd see in a Star Wars movie. He also got pretty good performances out of Adam Driver and Carrie Fisher (some of her best work here too; R.I.P.). I wish he'd come back for IX, but he's got a whole new trilogy in the works so I'm ready for that. He did his best to answer our questions without really answering them, which kind of bummed me out, but he told a good story. 3/4"", ""PERFORMANCES: Mark Hamill was great in this movie. I wonder if he'll get nominated? Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, and Daisy Ridley were all very good in the film; Boyega was more restrained but so was his character, being on Canto Bight so fart apart from the rest of the action."", 'Newcomers Kelly Mary Tran, Laura Dern, and Benicio Del Toro all delivered decent performances for their respective underdeveloped characters. 3/4', 'CINEMATOGRAPHY: Some of the best cinematography in Star Wars. The shots, the angles, the movements, all very good and stylistically unique to the franchise without straying too far into unusual territory. 4/4', ""EDITING: It's definitely a little long, and some plot points should have been shortened. They kept cutting away from Luke and Rey and that was the most interesting stuff. But overall the movie made sense and helped tighten the emotion of the dialogue. 3/4"", ""MUSIC: I liked this score a lot better than Williams' last outing, which underwhelmed me. This one felt more like the original trilogy, but it also blending old and new themes. Though not as memorable as the rest of films, it was more unique than the Force Awakens. 3/4"", ""SOUND DESIGN: Stat Wars pretty much invented sound design, so it's no surprise here that the sound transports you into a galaxy far, far away. 4/4"", ""ACTION / SPECIAL EFFECTS: Excellent! Rian Johnson knows how to helm action, he used a lot of practical effects, the CGI was pretty good. The action scenes were good but a bit long, and you don't always feel invested in it because of the characters and their goals. 3/4"", ""Overall, Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is kind of astounding.

There are breadcrumbs for an interesting movie here, where things are more much complicated than merely ""Resistance vs. Empire"", ""Jedi vs. Sith"", and the movie does a good job of sending signals through the first few acts that it wants us to look deeper at this (apparently) never ending war between flawed antagonists who\'ve been granted superhuman powers. Then we get to the end of the movie, and it\'s either the director, or Disney, or both, who blinks. Nuance is thrown out the window, all of those interesting ideas are given a big ""Nevermind!"", and we\'re back to the same old simplistic face-off between virtue and evil we\'ve been watching for decades now.', ""This movie doesn't have the courage to live up to what were, as expressed earlier in the film, it's apparent convictions. This is both maddening as a viewer, because the movie has a habit of leading you down paths that eventually go nowhere (for a plot example: the entire casino thread), and disappointing intellectually because you're left thinking about what this movie could've been if its makers hadn't blinked in the end and reverted back to the franchise's (now a bit tired) formula. This type of safe film making has typified the last two installments of Star Wars. The first movie got a pass for not taking any risks because we were just all so thirsty to see these characters and this world again. This movie less so, because at this point the groundwork has been laid, characters introduced, fans appeased, and now was the time to expand and challenge the universe as all good sequels are expected to. Far from expanding, the movie betrays itself and its own characters to the extent that the two biggies, Kylo and Rey, end the film in less interesting places than they started it (the descent from complicated creatures into paragons of virtue or vice is not an improvement in my book), and instead of being dramatic the final act feels like just another face-off between the good guys and bad guys, where the visuals are the only thing that's new."", ""This movie fails spectacularly in the task of all sequels, namely to take the previous film's ingredients in a new and interesting directions, all the more so because it clearly is aware that some iconoclasm is warranted, but when push comes to shove it either backs off entirely or heavily dilutes it with forced levity. So while this movie was certainly more entertaining to watch than many of its predecessors, the opportunities it squanders via either timidity or failed execution leave it as one of the most disappointing Star Wars films I've ever seen.""]"

The plot requires contrived delays in time, such as when Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) go off to look for the codebreaker.

The professional critics who praised this mess are so wrong that I\'m starting to believe the Disney payola conspiracy theories. I mean I guess making an atrociously bad movie and calling it Star Wars was a pretty ""bold"" and ""unexpected"" decision. But that doesn\'t mean it\'s enjoyable. When the best things people can say about a movie are that the visuals are impressive (and they are) and that the cast is superficially diverse (and it is) you\'ve got one of those goddawful Matrix sequels on your hands, not something that warrants gushing comparisons to The Empire Strikes Back. The plot [or lack thereof], insipid characters, pacing, dialogue and ""twists"" in this movie are all horrendous and should insult the intelligence of the 4th graders at whom most of the cringeworthy attempts at humor were aimed.', ""Apparently Kathleen Kennedy and her wretched minions weren't content to just make a dumb, forgettable film. No, for reasons that are unfathomable to any rational person, Kathleen and Rian Johnson felt it necessary to drop trou and take a flaming liquid dump all over the formerly-cherished character now known as Jake Skywalker and the mythos of an iconic franchise. The Force Awakens nullified the original trilogy's story and mishandled classic characters because JJ Abrams is a creatively-bankrupt hack: unfortunate, but not necessarily malicious. In contrast, The Last Jedi is a smirking hipster douchebag's middle finger in the face of anyone who ever had any sort of affinity for Star Wars.

976258874	['Phil S']	3.0	"[""For better or for worse, Rian Johnson accomplishes what most were asking for out of the next Star Wars film: a new direction. It is both refreshing and problematic in that the new themes The Last Jedi explores are interesting, but at the same time it only scratches the surface for many of them. The film also unfortunately suffers from pacing issues and plot holes. An entire subplot involving a visit to an alien casino was wholly unnecessary and gobbled up too much screen time. A new hyperspace maneuver that the Resistance uses is a deus ex machina that calls into question why or how this was never used before in previous space battles. The final confrontation is anticlimactic and skirts what could have been a potentially satisfying saber duel. In fact, there is not even a single true jedi-on-jedi lightsaber duel in this entire movie. That could maybe be forgiven if this film still had a proper climax, but it doesn't, so what we're left with is a very uneven and lukewarm conclusion. When we said we wanted new directions, that doesn't mean neglecting one of Star Wars' most iconic weapons just for the sake of subverting fan expectations. The Last Jedi is clearly a deconstructionist film; made specifically to take established tropes and smash them to bits. While it surprisingly works most of the time, there is a reason certain tropes became tropes: because they've been proven to be effective and satisfying storytelling techniques. Like many deconstructions, TLJ tries to break conventions, but in doing so, it struggles to consistently replace the familiar with equally satisfying new story beats. Despite all of these problems, Rian Johnson has managed to craft a film that definitely feels like a singular passionate vision; not a market-tested assembled-by-committee piece like its predecessor. The Last Jedi poses big ideas and elevates the character drama like never before in a Star Wars film. It also brings back one other crucial component that has been often ignored in recent iterations of Star Wars, and that would be the actual star wars. Space battles. Ship-on-ship combat. Sure we got some of it in Rogue One, but none of it ever really took center stage in the plot like it does in this film. Here we see battle tactics and consequences at play, giving real weight to the conflicts that unfold. Luke's fleshed out backstory is similarly nuanced in a brilliant way that shows the mark of a talented character writer. It's just disappointing that despite Johnson's direction and writing prowess with characters, he flounders when it comes to pacing and plot.""]"

Visually stunning, this is not a terrible movie by any means, but it doesn\'t live up to the standard that the original trilogy had and what I had hoped for when Rian Johnson, who directed some of the best episodes of Breaking Bad (the greatest show ever), was announced as the director. It seemed as if they made the movie for everybody but fans of the original trilogy and it had the stink of George Lucas and Disney all over it.

The only thing missing was a scene between Vice Admiral Holdo and Rose talking about their Tumblr blogs on taking down the patriarchy and noting the carbon footprint of the Millennium Falcon.

We needed it to show them that a radical new direction full of unexpected twists isn\'t the golden ticket to a fantastic film.

In other words, the execution matters too, not just a flashy vision.', ""So in a way it was good that this movie disappointed fans, because the backlash will be hard to ignore. And we know that Disney listens, because we got stuck with Rian Johnson in the first place based on criticism of the movie's predecessor - so there's still hope!"", ""Yes, the Force Awakens was a good movie that was overall well-liked by critics and fans. J.J. Abrams and his team managed to get a new generation of people excited about a 40 year old story by creating interesting, diverse characters that we all wanted to learn more about, all while maintaining the charm of the original trilogy and respecting what came before it. But that's ALL he did, according to a vocal minority - he did the bare minimum. He didn't push the limits, they said. He played it too safe. Much of the criticism centered on this being basically a remake of a New Hope. Starkiller base was just a bigger Death Star 3.0 that had the same convenient flaw. Jakku was a Tatooine for the millennial era. The cantina scene was basically...the same cantina scene but with different music. It was entirely expected."", ""So in walks Rian Johnson to the room full of Disney higher-ups who you better believe are facing the harsh realization that their multi-billion dollar purchase is not going to keep delivering returns if they keep remaking things, and he says just the right things: we're going to explore a new direction for The Force. Our heroes are going to be humanized, impacted by the same mistakes and cynicism that we are. Legacy won't matter. Failure is going to be the best lesson. It'll all be different. Have it at Rian - give us the UNexpected!"", ""The problem is that Rian was so preoccupied with teaching us his lessons about how we need to move on from the past (with lessons about animal cruelty, slavery, the vices of the rich, and war profiteering thrown in for good measure) that he forgets about the execution of the movie. If he had spent less time trying to convince us that new and different is good, and that we shouldn't care about the questions raised in the previous movie because that's part of the past, then maybe this might have actually turned into a worthy addition to the Star Wars canon."", ""Instead, we get convenience and lazy screenwriting, all for the sake of proving his points. Take Finn as an example. Ok, so we need to develop his character more, so let's give him a side quest with Rose. We'll put a hacker in the cell that that they are thrown in for parking, because that's easiest. Then BB-8 will save the day a couple times because that's easy too. Throw in a CGI horse sequence because we didn't learn from the prequels. DJ will teach him that the lines between good and evil are blurry. Then Rose will teach him that saving people you love is more important than killing those that you hate, and we'll do that by having her stop him from...saving the people he loves. It's all about the lesson, though, so we can also ignore the fact that they are stranded in front of the First Order with miles of open land between them and safety doesn't matter."", ""And that's just one character! On top of these maddening examples of bad writing, Rian also manages to lose the feel of Star Wars. Yes, this movie is visually gorgeous. But the combination of the close ups, the quick cuts, the slow-motion, the Rey mirror sequence, the Matrix-style dodges of Luke in the final battle all add up to a movie that feels more like an Interstellar sequel than a Star Wars film. At least J.J. Abrams prioritized the practical effects and familiar patina that gave the galaxy a grounded, lived-in feel. Abrams even kept the campy screen transitions of the originals. In other words, he cared about making something that was true to its context."", ""I'll end this commentary by imploring you to ignore the cinema-splaining of the people-that-know-movies-better-than-you. Don't let them fool you into thinking that these themes are fresh and cool and the movie is better because it's different. We don't have to believe that the best way to show Luke's internal struggle with his mistake is by having him run around like an unhinged recluse milking alien sea cows and jumping around on a pole vault/fishing spear. We don't have to believe that the best way to showcase Leia's dormant Force powers is by showing that she can survive explosions, shrapnel and the vacuum of space while Mary Poppins-ing around. And we certainly don't have to believe that the best way to redeem Luke's character in the end is not by having him actually face danger head-on alongside his friends/family like a real hero, but by creating a never-before-seen astral projection of himself, wiping dirt off his shoulder, and then dying anyway."", ""The controversial new direction may distract us at first, but in the end this movie goes to show us that an unhealthy preoccupation with destroying the past is not a recipe for a home run.

It should be pointed out that The Last Jedi seemed like a bloated, fragmented assortment of poorly connected scenes and little else. Furthermore, the ham-handed? attempt at diversity and inclusion was so poorly executed and serves only to saddle TLJ as a movie that wanted to make a statement about social justice and not tell a good story. If Johnson's vision was to kill the past then he has indeed succeeded. The deconstructed script effectively cut any ties to the episodes that came before and it was helped along by Disney's filmmaking by committee, which appeared more interested in marketability and not in character and story development. If this were a relay race then Kathleen Kennedy, J. J. Abrams, Rian Johnson et. al. have dropped the baton.""]"
