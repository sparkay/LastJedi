      "'**SPOILERS** Kathleen Kennedy, JJ Abrams, et al. deliver another nostalgia film that fundamentally misunderstands what makes people nostalgic about the original trilogy. Sorry, but capturing those films\\' retro futuristic aesthetic doesn\\'t excuse nonsensical plotting or the destruction of beloved characters. The Force Awakens nullified Han and Leia\\'s character arcs and had Han regress into a washed up deadbeat dad space loser, then gave him a few mildly redemptive moments before his pointless death. The Last Jedi doesn\\'t nullify Luke\\'s character arc so much as make him a completely different character. Luke the noble optimist who redeemed his murderously evil dad through a dogged belief in his goodness, and whose greatest strength and weakness was abiding loyalty to his friends, is long gone. In his place, for no comprehensible reason, is a twisted misanthrope who utterly abandoned his friends to die at the hands of the nephew he considered murdering in cold blood for having some naughty thoughts. Now he\\'s hiding from the galaxy while it burns around him. Luke also gets a few mildly redemptive moments before his pointless death, but his characterization and much of the rest of the movie is a slap in the face to casual fans of the original trilogy. All of which might be justifiable as \"bold\" and \"post-modern\" if these movies\\' appeal (and profitability) weren\\'t largely based on nostalgia. Much like TFA, TLJ makes for reasonably fun viewing while you\\'re watching it and deeply disappoints on every level the moment you stop and think about it. Skip this movie.'\n"
