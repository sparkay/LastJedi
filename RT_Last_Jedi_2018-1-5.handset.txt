This movie took some risks, and alot of them i did not see coming at all! In fact, once i started to see how risky the writers and director were being, all bets were off. I didn't know where the story was heading and that was scary and refreshing at the same time. I didn't know who would die and who wouldn't. It made me anxious and it's been awhile since a Star Wars movie did that to me. Not counting Rogue One."", '-------------------------SPOILERS---------------------------', '-------------------------------------------------------------------', '-------------------------------------------------------------------', '-------------------------------------------------------------------', ""What i didn't like:"", ""The movie takes place literally right after EP VII, and then the movie proceeds to tell you the story of the next 30hours or so following the end of EP VII. I didn't like this. In terms of story building, the overarching story was very very short. And at times, it did feel a bit 'Empire vs Rebels', which isn't great but it is what it is. This reason and for this reason alone, i removed one star from my review. I would hope that EP IX, takes place much farther in the future which is what i feel like will happen."", ""I didn't like the fact a major OT character died, for this i mean *Spoliers* Luke Skywalker. Granted, he became of Force Ghost and is now one with the Force, so he isn't exactly dead but still gone. I didn't like this, it felt very 'empire' to me where the mentor is only around for a handful of scenes and then dies later."", 'Also, the lack of communication between some characters was stupid. A lot of story could have been shaved, saved, or made better had the new General whose name eludes just told Poe and Finn the plan. I could gather why she didnt but it would have helped.', 'The music, and the visuals were superb and classic as always. The story was solid, and made sense but it felt very short. Not in terms of IRL minutes but in terms of story time.', 'What i did like:', ""The risks it took. Snoke is dead, Kylo is now supreme leader, i didn't see this coming. This is something that would happen in the last arc of this trilogy but no, it happened here. I loved it but im also conflicted about it."", 'The scenes between Kylo and Rey where amazing and Luke was amazing, i understand why he was the he was and i respected him for it.', 'The force itself was interesting in this movie. We never seen communication across planets before, its been hinted but never seen. Same thing goes for Force projection. And then, my favorite, Yoda going Thor and summoning lighting as a freaking Force Ghost. This was amazing, daring, and risky all at once. I loved it!', ""Greatness can come from anywhere, Rey being the daughter of some junkrats makes sense since she is from Jakku (altho who was in the ship from VII?), Those kids on the casino planet WHO CAN USE THE FORCE, is awesome as well. You don't have to be from a historic line of Jedi/Sith to have powers. And i got that message loud and clear. And i loved it."", ""I hope everyone who sees this movie will enjoy it for what it is. Its a new take, and it takes risks not many would, for that i applaud it and for that i will see the next movie. And for those who have their doubts, i would ask to just see it with an open mind. Your theories and wishes may not come true but thats okay. It's a fantastic movie with some faults but it is a great ride and one that leaves you guessing, wondering and hoping for the best in the next Star Wars movie.""]"
